## Extras
#### Programming
- Use of the [visitor pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) to implement the required multiple dispatch for collision detection between two arbitrary shapes.
- Functions whose sole purpose is to be `call`ed on objects to replicate a sort of trait/mixin construct, used to add shape-related properties and behavior to bumpers.
- [Immediate-invoked function expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) used both as namespaces and for the encapsulation of properties and methods within a "class".
