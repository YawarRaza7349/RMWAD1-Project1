			Our media experience will consist of a Canvas display split into two sides. The left side will be a drawing canvas, similar to our Drawing App ICE. The right side will be a box that has numerous bouncing particles. In addition, the user can click a location on the right side, and in doing so, creates a shape (henceforth known as a "bumper") at that location. Its size is proportional to how long the user clicks that location. When the user lets go, its size is set. The particles will then bounce off these bumpers when they collide. The bumpers can also pulsate, and the way they pulsate depends on what is drawn on the drawing canvas. The exact details have yet to be determined, but one idea is that the region on the drawing canvas corresponding to a bumper can have its pixels of each color counted, and that can be used to vary the pulsation of that bumper. We will use HTML widgets to control the visual style of the right side of the screen, as well as changing the shapes of the bumpers you create, and control the colors/pen size of the drawing app. HTML widgets could also control other aspects of the visual style of the drawing app, and the physics of the right side (speed of the particles, perhaps adding gravity, etc.).

			One inspiration is <a href="http://processing.org/examples/springs.html">this "springy" Processing example</a>. I know I've seen the "expands the longer you hold the mouse" idea in one or more places, but I don't remember exactly where. I think I've also seen a similar "bumper simulation" idea somewhere as well. The pulsating bumper idea actually came from originally thinking of how they could be synchronized with audio, but the drawing idea seemed easier to implement and more unique.
